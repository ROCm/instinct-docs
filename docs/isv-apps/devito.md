# DevitoPRO

In the high-stakes world of oil and gas exploration, the ability to accurately model and predict the location of valuable resources can mean the difference between a dry well and a gusher. High-performance computing (HPC) plays a crucial role in this process, but the complexity of HPC software often creates a barrier for domain specialists. Enter Devito Codes, a software company that's breaking down these barriers with its innovative product, Devito Pro. In a recent conversation, Devito Codes' co-founders, CEO Gerard Gorman and Director of Business Development and Strategy Paul Holzhauer, shared insights on the company's objectives and its strategic collaboration with AMD.
