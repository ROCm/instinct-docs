# Cadence Fidelity LES Solver

Cadence Fidelity LES Solver, formerly Cascade CharLES, is the industry’s first high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis engine that expands the applicability of large eddy simulations (LES) into the mainstream aerospace, automotive, and turbomachinery domains. Designed to scale, Fidelity LES Solver addresses the most demanding fluid dynamics challenges by accurately predicting traditionally complex problems for CFD in aeroacoustics, aerodynamics, combustion, heat transfer, as well as multiphase applications.
