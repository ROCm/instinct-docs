# Stone Ridge Technology ECHELON

Stone Ridge Technology (SRT) pioneered the use of GPUs for high performance reservoir simulation (HPC) nearly a decade ago with ECHELON, its flagship software product. ECHELON, the first of its kind, engineered from the outset to harness the full potential of massively parallel GPUs, stands apart in the industry for its power, efficiency, and accuracy. Now, ECHELON has added support for AMDInstinct accelerators into its simulation engine, offering new flexibility and optionality to its clients.
