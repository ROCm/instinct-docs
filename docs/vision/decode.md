# Video and Image decoding

Leverage the power of AMD Instinct GPUs to quickly decode a wide variety of image and video formats. Eliminate bottlenecks with these libraries and accelerate your training, finetuning, and inference workloads by ensuring quick and easy access to your data.

## Video decoding

Decode videos for use in your computer vision workloads with [rocDecode](https://github.com/ROCm/rocDecode) or its Python bindings, [rocPyDecode](https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode). These libraries support the H.264, H.265, AV1, and VP9 video codecs and enable video decoding on AMD Instinct GPUs.

## Image decoding

The [rocJPEG](https://github.com/ROCm/rocJPEG) library enables fast and efficient JPEG decoding on AMD GPUs. This library includes the ability to run on batches to quickly decode large numbers of images simultaneously, fully utilizing the advantages offered by AMD Instinct GPUs.
