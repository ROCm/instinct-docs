# AI models and applications

[MIVisionX](https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX) is a comprehensive toolkit consisting of a set of computer vision and machine intelligence libraries, utilities, and applications which enable you to build a wide variety of applications and models. MIVisionX delivers a highly optimized implementation of the [Khronos OpenVX Extensions](https://www.khronos.org/openvx/) along with Convolutional Neural Network model compilers and optimizers supporting [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) and [NNEF](https://www.khronos.org/nnef) exchange formats. This toolkit enables the rapid prototyping and deployment of optimized computer vision and machine learning inference workloads on AMD Instinct GPUs.

The MIVisionX toolkit provides you with all the necessary tools you need throughout the whole neural network life-cycle. Use these tools to design, develop, quantize, prune, retrain, and infer your neural network on the powerful AMD Instinct family of GPUs.
