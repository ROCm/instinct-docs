# hipDF

hipDF enables GPU accelerated dataframes and dataframe operations. This library, built on top of ROCm, enables large scale data processing on AMD Instinctâ„¢ GPUs, allowing you to perform many data manipulation operations at breakneck speeds. Built on the familiar [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) memory format and using APIs similar to the well known Python [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/), hipDF allows you to not only build accelerated data processing workloads, but with minimal effort you can accelerate your existing Pandas applications. 

hipDF is currently in an Early Access state and is intended as a preview to the production ready release planned for later this year.
