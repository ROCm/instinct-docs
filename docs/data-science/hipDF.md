# hipDF

hipDF enables GPU accelerated dataframes and dataframe operations. This library, built on top of ROCm, enables
large scale data processing on AMD Instinctâ„¢ GPUs, allowing you to perform many data manipulation operations
at breakneck speeds. Built on the familiar [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) memory format and using
APIs similar to the well known Python [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/), hipDF allows you to not
only build accelerated data processing workloads, but with minimal effort you can accelerate your existing
Pandas applications.

hipDF is currently in an Early Access state and is intended as a preview to the production ready release
planned for later this year.
