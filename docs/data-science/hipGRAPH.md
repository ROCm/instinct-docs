# hipGRAPH

hipGRAPH enables GPU accelerated complex networks and graphs, and contains a set of well-known graph
algorithms. This library, built on top of ROCm™, enables you to build, analyze, and otherwise manipulate
complex graphs on AMD Instinct™ GPUs.

hipGRAPH is currently in an Early Access state and is intended as a preview to the production ready release
planned for later this year.
